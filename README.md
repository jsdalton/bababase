# Bababase

Bababase is a web app that helps the user peer into a more comprehensive set of data about baby names than the usual top 1,000 lists. At present it's more of a hacking excercise than anything else.

## Built With

* [Caribou](https://github.com/caribou/caribou) - A Clojure framework for building web apps built on top of [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring).
* [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) - A library for manipulating documents based on data.
* Other fun stuff!

## Website

Some day there might be a website. It'll probably be at [http://bababase.com](http://bababase.com). But right now there's not!
